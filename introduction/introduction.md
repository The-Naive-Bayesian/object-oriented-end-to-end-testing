End-to-end testing is something of a wild west in the tech industry.

There are certainly a number of common tools (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright)
and patterns in use (page objects, describe/test/before blocks), but in my experience
these are often differ widely between organizations.
Because of this, it can be difficult to develop a personal framework to approach test automation,
for newcomers and more experienced developers alike.

I decided to write this document to state my own personal approach to test automation.
This is not intended to be a manifesto of the "right" way to do testing,
nor to denigrate other approaches. Instead, I hope this can be a starting point for discussion
about how to approach end-to-end testing in a disciplined way.
