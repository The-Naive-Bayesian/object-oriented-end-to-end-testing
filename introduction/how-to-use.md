# How to Use This Document
[&larr; Previous: Introduction](./introduction.md)

This document can either be read sequentially or just for specific chapters.
That said, some concepts will build on and refer to previous ones; knowledge of
previous chapters will be assumed.

Part 1 goes over some core principles of object-oriented programming, and of programming in general.
Though these are generally not directly related to testing,
they provide a solid foundation on which we can build and discuss our approach.

Part 2 discusses some important potential objects/classes that can be used in end-to-end testing frameworks.
Some of these are directly supported by popular testing libraries,
while others will likely need to be implemented by test maintainers.

Finally, Part 3 provides some practical advice and suggestions on building and maintaining a test project.
The examples in this section will generally be more concrete, and may or may not apply to any specific
project. Feel free to take from this section whatever you find useful.
